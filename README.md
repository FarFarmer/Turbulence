# Turbulence
This repository contains code to make a neural network that determines if an aircraft is flying through very turbulent, somewhat turbulent, or calm weather based on accelerometer readings. This also includes datasets and unlabeled data that requires processing to be used as datasets. The neural networks are written in Python, using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
